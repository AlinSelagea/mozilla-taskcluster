    Pushlog Commit Events
  description: |
    The pushlog events can be used to hook various other components into
    the act of commiting to a particuar repository (usually to kick off tests)
    this exchange is hopefuly a short lived thing which abstracts polling the
    pushlog for new data.

    Pushes will be monitored (via polling) and events will be sent as new data
    is available. If for some reason the service goes down previous commits
    will also be fetched and any missing data (up to a particular amount) will
    be sent as events...
